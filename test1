test for the get_next_line project at school 42. (cursus42, november 2019) mainly combinatory tricky tests :)

1/ copy the 3 files get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c s"

2/ in the root directory, 

3/ GNL_lover does a nice little check on the multi fd at the very end of this script. it also helps the corrector for different correction key points: - read function is using the BUFFER_SIZE defined value. - no global - works with BUFFER_SIZE=1 (many tests) - works with BUFFER_SIZE=1024 - single static variable is used? (bonus)

4/ keep

5/ what it does technicaly.
